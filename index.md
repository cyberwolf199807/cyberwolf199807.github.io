## If you 've come here, you are probably here for a reason
`This module provides you with a guessing game'   
`guessinggame.sh` consists of a menu driven code/bash script
**All you have to do is to guess number of files in the current directory**:
1. Make your guess.
2. If your guess is close then prompt says too high.
3. If your guess is not so then prompt says too low.
4. If you manage to hit the bullseye, you are congragulated.
