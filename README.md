#  -----------------------------Guessgame---------------
# Hi there, This is cyberwolf1998 at your service!
## If you 've come here, you are probably here for a reason
`This module provides you with a guessing game'   
The script guessinggame.sh consists of a menu driven code.
**All you have to do is to guess number of files in the current directory** :
1. Make your guess.
2. If your guess is close then prompt says too high.
3. If your guess is not so then prompt says too low.
4. If you manage to hit the bullseye, you are congragulated.

# Please go and check that code right after!
